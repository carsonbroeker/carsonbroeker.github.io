Hello! I'm Carson, a 5th year PhD candidate in the lab of <a href='https://cancer.msu.edu/faculty/andrechek-eran'>Eran Andrechek</a> at <a href='https://msu.edu/'>Michigan State University</a>. I utilize eukaryotic *in vitro* models and murine *in vivo* models to study breast cancer development and progression. Frequent methods I use to interrogate these models include genomics, transcriptomics, molecular biology, data science, and machine learning.

My thesis project is concerned with investigating the mechanisms of metastasis of a <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11236-3'>conserved human and murine genomic amplification event</a> that is present in 25% of HER2+ and 9% of all breast cancer patients. Patients that have this amplication event centered on chromosome 17q21.33 exhibit increased metastasis and worse overall survival. My project aims to:

1. Identify stages of metastasis altered
2. Elucidate signaling pathways involved in patients with increased metastasis
3. Find precision therapeutics to selectively target the amplification event

Check out my <a href='https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01723-3'>latest work</a> in using genomics and transcriptomics to interrogate the heterogeneity present in the MMTV-Myc mouse model of breast cancer.

I will be graduating in 2025 and am currently open to employment opportunities in bioinformatics, data science, data engineering, and artificial intelligence. Don't hesitate to reach out or connect on LinkedIn!
